# FavTopTenWebsite
This is a classroom project using HTML, CSS Bootstrao,
we used free Figma to create a prototype
Once the prototype was approved we use HTML for the Website structure
We used CSS Bootstrap for the styling of the HTML file, we also used modals linked to our top ten list
The Modal includes a piture, paragraph and YouTube video about each top 10 item.
